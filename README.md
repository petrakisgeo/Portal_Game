# Portal_Game
A 3D game with Portals (inspired by the popular Valve game series) developed using the C++ OpenGL module. This game was a 6-month project for the "Computer Graphics and Virtual Reality" course, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Patras.

To start: run the lab07.exe file or open the .sln file to open the Virtual Studio project

Controls: Appendix at the end of the .pdf file

//Project Summary//

In this project, I used Computer Graphics theory and 3D Matrix Transformations to tackle the problems of:
  1. Portal image generation, including the problem of "recursive" Portals (eg. the "infinite corridor" illusion)
  2. "Smooth" object mesh teleportation, with a personal re-implementation of the same idea used in the Portal Valve studio games
  3. Portal "Physics" and collisions in 3D

The game was developed from low level, meaning we explicitly deal with movement and collision detection algorithms, but also lighting and shading schemes with GPU shader programming

All transformations, physics and "illusion" schemes used to imitate the expected function of a Portal in 3D are explained in depth in the .pdf file.

Some of the model meshes (like the stage) were created by me using "Blender" software and others were found online as open source material

The report on the project is provided both in Greek (original, as a project report for the course) and also translated by DeepL translator to English.
